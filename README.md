# React JS Landing Page Template with [chakra-ui](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui) and Typescript


### <a href="https://react-landing-page-template.herokuapp.com">LIVE DEMO</a> 

## Description
This is a ReactJS based landing page template, fit for a startup company/service with a one page view. The design is inspired by a template from <a href="https://www.free-css.com/assets/files/free-css-templates/preview/page234/interact/">Free-CSS.com </a>
All componenets data can be easily modified to git use by changing the data.JSON file that contains all data.

This example features how to use [chakra-ui](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui) as the component library within a Next.js app with typescript.

Next.js and chakra-ui have built-in TypeScript declarations, so we'll get autocompletion for their modules straight away.

We are connecting the Next.js `_app.js` with `chakra-ui`'s Provider and theme so the pages can have app-wide dark/light mode. We are also creating some components which shows the usage of `chakra-ui`'s style props.

## Make it Yours!
### 1. Preps
You will need to have <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node JS</a> installed on your pc. 

### 2. Clone Files
After cloning the files, you will have to run ```yarn``` followed by ```yarn start``` in the CLI
### 3. Add your own data 
Change the data in the ```data.JSON``` file as well as add any images to ```public/img/```
You can also change styles by modifying the ```public/css``` files.
